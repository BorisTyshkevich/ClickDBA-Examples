## Practical notes
- `async` mode: runs all updates with no coordination.
- Default behavior is described as “fast, safe,” and generally correct for most workloads.
- Coordination is automatic/transparent to the operator; updates “feel like SQL”.

## Settings & knobs
- `update_sequential_consistency = 0` (off by default)
- `update_sequential_consistency = 1` ensures each update sees the latest visible state (performance cost).
- `async` (mode): no coordination (exact setting name/value not specified in this chunk).

## Examples
```sql
UPDATE orders
SET discount = 0.2
WHERE quantity >= 40;
```
- Standard SQL `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...` is supported (example shown).

## Gotchas
- `update_sequential_consistency` has a performance cost when enabled.
- `async` updates have “no coordination” (may matter for ordering/visibility expectations; details not specified here).

## Verification
- Verify via normal query reads after the `UPDATE` (specific verification queries not provided in this chunk).
- If using `update_sequential_consistency = 1`, expect updates to reflect the latest visible state per update.
- If using `async`, don’t assume coordinated/serialized update visibility across concurrent updates (details not specified here).
